# C-CUBE
C-CUBE-Standard-Interpreter is a standard interpreter developed for the programming language called C-CUBE developed by Sahne Dünya. C-CUBE is a programming language created to be the default language of the Python-based Game engine developed by Sahne Dünya and to develop Games. The main reason for the development of this programming language is to create a new revolution in the Game World. Because most of the programming languages ​​are almost impossible to create a modern video game using the Standard Library, so they mostly need external APIs. However, since the C-CUBE standard library is focused on game development, the necessary APIs are automatically included in the standard library. In addition, C-CUBE is based on Python, and those who start with Python will know that it is easier to program than many languages. It is also an interpretable language, which provides ease of development, although sometimes there may be performance losses, but this is a good feature. C-CUBE is very important for software developers who play a role in the game world. Maybe in the future, software developers who are interested in the game world can start training with C-CUBE instead of Python. But I need your support for every good result.
